# Never Drift - Lyrics

## Verse 1
They call me when it's critical, when failure ain't an option
When everybody else fall off, I never stop rockin
From the server to the silicon, I'm locked and I'm ready
Hand steady, aim deadly, money flow already

They tried to do it cheap, now they paying for the difference
I built it from the ground up, that's the cost of persistence
You want it done right, you want proof on the table
I'm the only one who's able, that's a fact not a fable

## Pre-Chorus
Check the receipts, check the math, check the time
Every single run comes out the same every time

## Chorus
Never miss, never drift, always hit the mark
Light it up from the edge, we don't play in the dark
Run it back, run it twice, get the same thing twice
Luxi Edge on the beat and the numbers precise

## Verse 2
Wall Street on the phone, need the audit to clear
Defense contract pending, need the proof right here
ML models training, need the runs to repeat
I'm the engine underneath, I'm the reason it's complete

You can run it on your Mac, run it on the cloud
Run it anywhere you want, I say it loud and proud
Same hash every time, that's the guarantee
Luxi Edge in the game, there ain't no one like me

## Pre-Chorus
Check the receipts, check the math, check the time
Every single run comes out the same every time

## Chorus
Never miss, never drift, always hit the mark
Light it up from the edge, we don't play in the dark
Run it back, run it twice, get the same thing twice
Luxi Edge on the beat and the numbers precise

## Breakdown (Spoken)
Mac: different hash
Linux: different hash
That's your engine

Through Luxi Edge
Mac: seven-eight-one-A-E
Linux: seven-eight-one-A-E
Identical

That ain't a promise
That's a receipt

## Final Chorus
Never miss, never drift, always hit the mark
Light it up from the edge, we don't play in the dark
Run it back, run it twice, get the same thing twice
Luxi Edge on the beat and the numbers precise
